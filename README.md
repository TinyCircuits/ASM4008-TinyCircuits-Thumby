This project uses designs and concepts developed as part of the Arduino project and the LilyPad project.  The TinyCircuits design files themselves (schematics, PCB and libraries) are not directly derived from these works' design files and have been created new, however the concepts and basic architecture behind the TinyDuino and TinyLily products are derived and we thank the hard work of the organizations below for their contributions to open-source hardware:
